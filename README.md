# maintainers.txt

Parses `maintainers.txt` files in eLife Github repositories, printing a simple report of *what* is maintained by *whom*.

If any repository has no maintainers, the script will exit with a failure.

Accepts an optional input file mapping a `maintainer => alias`. This will replace the name of the maintainer output with 
something else (like an email address).

If an alias map was given and any repository has a maintainer not present in the map, the script will exit with a failure.
